Google Fit REST API Samples
================================

This is an Ionic project aiming to demo a couple of samples to consume [Google Fit REST API] (https://developers.google.com/fit/rest/) using JavaScript, JQuery AJAX, and AngularJS.

These samples show how to:
- Create and list data sources
- Create and obtain datasets (a set of data points)

How To Use
-----------------

To run the application, you need to follow the instructions given at [Get Started] (https://developers.google.com/fit/rest/v1/get-started) to:
- Get a Google Account,
- Activate access to the REST API,
- Create a client ID for the OAuth Playground,
- Authorize the Fitness REST API and Obtain access tokens.

Then put your access token (OAuth token) in the 'Authorization' request header (authCode in the app.js).
